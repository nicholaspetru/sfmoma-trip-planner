Hello, <%= @user.first_name %>

Thanks for choosing to use my SFMOMA guide to help gather artists and artworks of interest!

Be sure to ask about these artists when you visit the museum:
<% @artists.each do |artist| %>
  <% unless artist.nil? or artist.to_s.empty? %>
    -> <%= artist.tr('_', ' ') %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

And keep an eye out for these pieces when you visit the museum:
<% @artworks.each do |artwork| %>
  <% unless artwork.nil? or artwork.to_s.empty? %>
    <%= Artwork.get_artwork_name(artwork.tr('_', '.')) %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

Feel free to reply to this email with any questions.

Sincereley,
Nick
